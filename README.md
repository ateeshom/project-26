my recipe :

Step 1 - Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Step 2 - Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
 stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite,8         minutes. 

Step 3 -Drain the pasta.

Step 4 -Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. 

Step 5 -Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes.

Step 6 - Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.

Step 7 -Serve it by shreeding some cheddar cheese on top of the pasta.

Note : If you want to add any veggies then first stir fry them then add them to the pasta before adding the Chaddar cheese to the milk mixture (Step - 6).
